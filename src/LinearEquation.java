        When generating the m value (slope), here are examples of "printable" slopes:
           5, -5, 1/2, 6/8 (reducing not required), 8/5, -2/3, -18/7

        Here are non-examples of "printable" slopes:
     1/-2 (should be -1/2), -4/-3 (should be 4/3), 8/4 (should be reduced to 2),
           -12/3 (should be -4), 3/3 (should be 1), -6/6 (should be -1)

        HINT: Be sure to check if the line is horizontal and return an appropriate string,
        e.g. y = 6
        HINT: Absolute value might be helpful for ensuring proper placement of negative sign!


        When generating the b value, here are some examples of "printable" y-intercepts:
           + 1.0 	- 2.35	      + 12.5		- 8.0		+ 17.19

        Here are non-examples of "printable" y-intercepts:
           - -1.0 	+ -2.35	- -12.5	+ -8.0	     - -17.19	+ 0	- 0

        HINT: Absolute value might be helpful for printing negative y-intercepts as
               subtraction!
